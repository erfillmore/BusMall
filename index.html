  <h1>Welcome to BusMall's Market Analysis App!</h1>
    <p>BusMall is a startup. We hope to offer the end consumer a catalog of assorted high-end goods, to browse on long bus journeys!</p>
    <p>Since catelog's are expensive to print and distribute, we are running a text product, in which you, lucky tester, have the
      oppurtunity to guide what final products we put in the magazine. Here is how it works:</p>
      <ul><li>First, please look at the three images on your screen.</li>
        <li>Chose the product in which you are most interested relative to the other products on your screen.</li>
        <li>Click on the image.</li>
        <li>Do this fifteen times.</li>
        <li>At the end of go 15, the app will give you a table in which it notes what product was the most popular.</li>
      </ul>
